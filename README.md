## Face-Mask-Detection-using-Deep-learning
```
1. Download the dataset from kaggle.
2. Open the Jupyter Noteboook and open the creating_dataset file in the notebook.
3. Next run the file, It will generate data.npy and target.npy.
4. Next you have to run the ModelTraining file and it will save the model as 001 notation. Use your model file or you cam ref to the given one.
5. The last one is PredictionModel File which will predict the result with the help of your webcam. 
6. You can also run the facedetect.py file in vscode and copy the url from terminal to your chrome, it will open a website and will detect whether the person has wear a mask or not. 
7. Happy Journey!!

Abstract. Detecting the faces with mask in efficient way is becoming incredibly valuable, as it can be used in COVID-19
situation as well as it can play a major role to follow and identify criminals or terrorists. Because of the high occlusions
that result in the loss of face information, masked face identification is a far more difficult process. The proposed scheme
employed a way to states that a person had worn a mass or not. A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model is
developed using deep learning and combining Tensor Flow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and Open-CV to make the system as
accurate as possible. Moreover, using the Flask framework and a webcam, a real-time detection application has been created
that is capable of accurately predicting a person has wear a mask and not, as well as showing a label in the right corner of
the image. Categorical cross-entropy is applied as a loss function. The proposed model's validation accuracy is 97.45
percent. Anyone on the live stream who is not wearing a mask has a rectangle around their face that is red, with the dialogue
"NO MASK," while anyone who is wearing a mask gets a rectangle around their face that is green.
